"Albert Einstein proposed the theory of relativity while working in Switzerland. He had long discussions with Niels Bohr about quantum mechanics, which took place during conferences organized by the Solvay Institute."
"In the early 20th century, A. Einstein and N. Bohr debated the nature of reality. Their exchanges influenced researchers like Werner Heisenberg, who later worked in Germany during WWII."
"Heisenberg, often guided by the ideas of Bohr, contributed to the development of matrix mechanics. Meanwhile, the CERN institute near Geneva carried out experimental verifications decades later."
"CERN, based near Genève, is known for building the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The collider enabled scientists like Lisa Randall to explore extra dimensions in theoretical physics."
"Prof. Randall, a researcher from Harvard Univ., collaborated with physicist Michio Kaku to communicate complex theories to the public. They appeared on science shows produced by the BBC."
"Dr. Kaku once explained Einstein’s field equations in the context of string theory, suggesting a multiverse concept. This sparked debates with Neil DeGrasse T. during a public event in New York."
"In NYC, N. D. Tyson hosted an episode of Cosmos discussing the role of Edwin Hubble in discovering the universe’s expansion. The Hubble Space Tel. was later launched to honor him."
"The HST (Hubble Telescope) captured deep-field images, aiding scientists like Carl Sagan in conveying the ""pale blue dot"" message. Sagan, through his lectures at Cornell, inspired generations."
"At Cornell Univ., C. Sagan mentored students who later joined NASA's JPL to work on interstellar missions like Voyager. The project’s golden record had music selected by Ann Druyan."
"A. Druyan, a writer and producer, later married Carl S. and co-created the reboot of Cosmos with Neil D. Tyson. This version aired globally on NatGeo TV."
"Nat Geo Channel also featured documentaries on Richard Feynman, who worked on the Manhattan Proj. alongside Oppenheimer and E. Teller during the 1940s."
"Robert Oppenheimer, also called the “father of the atomic bomb,” faced trial during the McCarthy era. His ties with scientists like Leo Szilard and Einstein (Albert) were scrutinized."
"L. Szilárd, a Hungarian-American physicist, co-authored a letter with Al. Einstein to President Roosevelt, urging the US to develop atomic research ahead of Nazi Germany."
"In Berlin, before fleeing, Szilard had worked with Fritz Haber, who was known for developing chemical"
"The M. Planck Institute, located in modern-day Deutschland, continues to collaborate with international bodies like UNESCO and CERN for ethical AI and quantum computing research in Europe."
